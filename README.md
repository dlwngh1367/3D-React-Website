# Juho's webpage

This 3D portfolio webpage was developed using Three.js and React, ensuring compatibility with both desktop and
mobile devices. Users can manipulate a 3D stereoscopic model of Ireland, the sky, and planes by sliding the screen on
the main interface. user can also turn background music on and off by clicking the volume button. The user interface,
built with React, facilitates control over the 3D GLTF model implemented with Three.js. By utilizing JavaScript XML
code, users can also interact with the 3D stereoscopic models using keyboard controls.

The main page features comprehensive information about Juho Lee, while the About page highlights my skills and
experiences. I used tailwindcss to style each page and icon. The project page provides concise descriptions and
Github links for my web, mobile, Java, and Python projects.

The contact page is designed to enable visitors to send emails to Juho. I integrated emailjs for email functionality, an
a 3D fox is rendered on the page. The fox responds differently depending on the user's interaction, and if the user has
no interaction, the fox wags its tail, walks when the user is typing data into the text form, and runs when the user
presses the Send Email button, and when the transfer is successful or unsuccessful, an alert message is displayed at
the top of the screen.
